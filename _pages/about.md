## Research Experience
**Certified robustness in Deep ensembles**
2020.11-present
  * We conduct research on how to approximately calculate the certified robustness of deep ensembles.

**Adversarial defense by diversified simultaneous training of deep ensembles**
2019.08-2020.10
  * A novel strategy of diversified learning of high-level feature representations by ensemble networks was proposed;
  * Two regularization schemes in simultaneous training to facilitate the proposed diversified learning were developed;
  * Three measures of ensemble diversity were analyzed for adversarial defense in deep ensembles.

**A comparative study of the robustness of single and ensemble model**
2019.03-2019.07
  * We investigated the robust performance of ensemble DNNs based on traditional ensemble methods;
  * Ensemble SVM was firstly found to be less robust than single SVM in the black-box attack scenario;
  * We proposed the concept of gradient correlation, which can be used to evaluate the adversarial robustness;

**Model-Agnostic Adversarial Detection by Random Perturbations**
2018.07-2019.02
  * We proposed an effective adversarial detection method based on statistical analysis of model responses;
  * A theoretical analysis by relating the bound of random perturbations to the adversarial distortions was given;
